Mobile Angular UI glues together: 

- Angular 1.2+
- Bootstrap 3
- Angular directives for Bootstrap 3
- An essential set of Bootstrap 3 components for mobile (navbars, sidebars, switches ..)
- Icons with FontAwesome

### Some features:

- Mobile only Bootstrap 3
- Scalable Icons with FontAwesome
- Base css stripped out of responsive media queries that are put apart in separate files (just include what you need)
- Scrollable areas with iScroll
- Slide-out/slide-in Sidebar
- Bottom navbar
- Justified Buttons
- Customizable build workflow with Grunt
- Its lighter than Bootstrap 3 + Jquery + Angular Js
